                <p>Yoga is about connecting - to the body, the breath, the spirit, and a community of fellow yogis.
                    We’ve curated our space to embody this.

                    Get flowing in our state of the art movement studios, find stillness in one of our meditation pods,
                    and wash it all off in our outdoor showers!

                    Up Dog isn’t just a building, it’s a community, and we’d love for you to be a part of it.
                </p>
